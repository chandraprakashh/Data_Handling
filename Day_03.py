"""
When we use = operator user thinks that this creates a new object; well, it doesn’t. 
It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the original object.

A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating 
it with references to the child objects found in the original. 
The copying process does not recurse and therefore won’t create copies of the child objects themselves


A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a 
new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the 
child objects found in the original.
Copying an object this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully 
independent clone of the original object and all of its children.


Making a shallow copy of an object won’t clone child objects. 
Therefore, the copy is not fully independent of the original.

A deep copy of an object will recursively clone child objects. 
The clone is fully independent of the original, but creating a deep copy is slower.

List Comprehension 
"""

"""
List Comprehension is a handy and faster way to create lists in Python in just a single line of code. 
It helps us write easy to read for loops in a single line.

List comprehensions are used for creating new list from another iterables.
As list comprehension returns list, they consists of brackets containing 
the expression which needs to be executed for each element along with the 
for loop to iterate over each element.
