# Enumerate 

"""
A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count 
of iterations.
Python eases the programmers’ task by providing a built-in function enumerate()
for this task.

Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of 
enumerate object.
This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or 
be converted into a list of tuples using list() method.

Syntax:
enumerate(iterable, start=0)

# Writing clean python

"""
When to Use Namedtuples

Namedtuples can be an easy way to clean up your code and to make it more 
readable by enforcing a better structure for your data.

I find, for example, that going from ad-hoc data types like dictionaries 
with a fixed format to namedtuples helps me express my intentions more 
clearly. Often when I attempt this refactoring I magically come up with 
a better solution for the problem I’m facing.

#Solution is NAMEDTUPLE

# Returning Multiple Values From a Function
"""
Functions return one thing. 
When we return multiple values, we’re actually creating a tuple and 
returning it (again, one value).

As the number of values to return grows, the code becomes harder to read. 
In particular I have the rule of thumb, that for more than 3 arguments, 
namedtuples should always be used instead.
